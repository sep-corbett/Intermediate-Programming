# J - remember it is 6:45am on Sunday when I decided to do this :)

# My initial CA-1 thoughts on code
# create a very simple Pokédex, using Python Classes...
# starting with Pokemon Black/White 2 - Oshawatt, Snivy and Tepig

# let's begin with the Pokemon Class:
# so based on these links, what do I add to my base parent class:
# https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/oshawott
# https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/snivy

# is it type, waeaknesses, details, stats?  where do I start.

# let's start with all 3, so first decision what is the type of these inputs:

from typing import ClassVar

    __pokemon_weaknesses: ClassVar[dict[list]] # dictionary of weaknesses in a list
